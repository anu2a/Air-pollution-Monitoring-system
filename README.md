# AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING IOT
This is **IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring System** which measures indoor harmful gases present in air like Carbon Dioxide(CO2) using an MQ135 gas sensor and Carbon Monoxide(CO) using an MQ7 sensor. It will show the air quality in PPM(Parts Per Million) on the LCD and as well as on [Thingspeak](https://thingspeak.com/channels/1347787) so that we can monitor it very easily in PPM.

## Components Requirement:
- Arduino Uno
- Wi-Fi module Node-MCU ESP8266
- 16x2 LCD
- MQ135 Gas sensor
- MQ 7 LPG gas sensor
- Buzzer
- LEDs

## System Architecture:

## Software Requirement:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/)
> Arduino IDE used to upload programming in Arduino board and Node-MCU board with required library.
- [Thingspeak](https://thingspeak.com/)
> ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize, and analyze live data streams in the cloud. You can send data to ThingSpeak from your devices, create instant visualization of live data, and send alerts.
